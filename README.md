# TICK Monitoring Project

## Overview

This project utilizes the TICK Stack (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, and Grafana) for efficient monitoring and visualization of metrics. Track system performance, collect data from various sources, and create insightful dashboards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Internet connectivity for downloading Docker images

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd your-repo

3. Start the TICK Stack
   docker-compose up -d

This will spin up InfluxDB, Telegraf, Chronograf, and Grafana containers.

### Configuration
Telegraf: Update telegraf.conf with specific metrics sources and destinations.
Grafana: Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (default credentials: admin/admin). Add InfluxDB as a data source with URL http://influxdb:8086.

### Usage
Collecting Metrics
Telegraf is configured to collect system metrics by default.
Customize telegraf.conf for additional data sources like databases, services, etc.
